# RESUME-CLASSIFICATION-AND-ANALYSIS
Finding suitable candidates for open roles can be a challenging and timeconsuming
task, particularly when faced with a large volume of applicants, which
can impede team progress and delay hiring, affecting overall productivity. To
address this issue, an automated approach to "Resume Classification and
Matching" is proposed, leveraging machine learning techniques. The system
categorizes resumes into appropriate groups using various classifiers that analyze
content based on skills, experience, and other criteria. Once classified, contentbased
recommendation methods such as cosine similarity and k-Nearest
Neighbors are employed to rank top candidates according to the job description,
enabling recruiters to identify the most suitable candidates quickly and
efficiently. By automating screening and shortlisting, the system eliminates
manual review, saving valuable time and resources for HR professionals while
ensuring a fair and unbiased selection process. Additionally, by considering a
larger pool of candidates, the system provides a more comprehensive review,
increasing the likelihood of finding the best fit for the role. Overall, the "Resume
Classification and Matching" system streamlines recruitment processes,
expediting candidate selection and decision-making, improving efficiency,
enhancing productivity, and contributing to the success of the hiring process.
